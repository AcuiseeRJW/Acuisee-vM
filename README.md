Code for mouse vision unit
Vision unit for the mouse differs from the rat since it uses a resistive touchscreen 
rather than limit switch actuation for animal selections.  This is due to the limited force requirements of using mice.
From a protocol standpoint, nothing changes with the Arduino to Control Tablet protocol.  Left touch is still 'a' 
Right touch is still 'c'
